I have recently updated the Engine Framework for this game to the latest version.
It is recommended that you use MinGW 9.2.0 to compile, however I still have MinGW 7.3.0 static libraries available for backwards compatibility.
Note: MinGW 10.2.0 is going to be the next supported compiler for the Engine Framework.
