Note:
This repository uses an old version of the SFML Engine Framework
I have yet to update the Engine Framework files in this repository.

If you wish to do it yourself:

Download the latest version of the Engine Framework repository.
Copy all the header files from the header directory (\*.h) into the Engine headers directory (/library/engine)
Copy the engine's compiled binary files into the libarary (/library). Make sure to use the MinGW 7.3.0 version!
*libengine64-s-730.a* and *libengine-s-730.a* are compiled with MinGW 7.3.0 so rename these files to *libengine64-s.a* and *libengine-s.a* respectively and put them in the library folder.

This will update the Engine Framework.
