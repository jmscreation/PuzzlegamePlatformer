# Puzzlegame Platformer
This is a game that was designed by the Engine Framework which is a wrapper for the SFML library.

You can download the GCC 10.2.0 compiler here:
https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/tag/10.2.0-11.0.0-8.0.0-r7

Find the Engine repository here: https://github.com/jmscreation/Engine

I have recently updated the Engine Framework for this game to the latest version.
This project officially supports MinGW GCC 10.2.0 for its compiler; however, GCC 7.3.0 static libraries are still available for backwards compatibility.
Note: MinGW GCC 10.2.0 is going to be only supported compiler for the Engine Framework eventually.


Older compilers will no longer be supported in the future:
(This is MinGW32 + MinGW64 GCC 7.3.0 + 9.2.0)
